/**
 * Represents a result from a traditional HTTP API. [ApiResult] has two sealed subtypes: [Success]
 * and [Failure]. [Success] is typed to [T] with no error type and [Failure] is typed to [E] with
 * no success type.
 *
 * [Failure] in turn is represented by four sealed subtypes of its own: [Failure.NetworkFailure],
 * [Failure.ApiFailure], [Failure.HttpFailure], and [Failure.UnknownFailure]. This allows for
 * simple handling of results through a consistent, non-exceptional flow via sealed `when` branches.
 *
 * ```
 * when (val result = myApi.someEndpoint()) {
 *   is Success -> doSomethingWith(result.response)
 *   is Failure -> when (result) {
 *     is NetworkFailure -> showError(result.error)
 *     is HttpFailure -> showError(result.code)
 *     is ApiFailure -> showError(result.error)
 *     is UnknownError -> showError(result.error)
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Usually, user code for this could just simply show a generic error message for a [Failure]
 * case, but a sealed class is exposed for more specific error messaging.
